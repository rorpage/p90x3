## FAQ

1. Did you change your diet?
 - Yes. I stopped eating so much sugar, I drink a ton of water now, and I basically skip bread and pasta (but I do occasionally eat them).

2. Did you use the DVDs?
 - At first, yes. Then we signed up for the $99/year subscription so I could easily turn it on in the mornings and just get going.

3. Would you recommend this to someone else.
 - Yeah!! It's really hard and there were _many_ days I didn't feel like doing it. I think it also took a bit of a toll on my shoulders and knees.

4. What's next?
 - I'm going to start training for a 5k in November 2019 and probably start Insanity X 30 (also on the Beachbody subscription thing).

5. What equipment did you need?
 - I got a yoga mat, used 2 3lb. dumbbells and 1 6lb. dumbbell, and a set of [resistance bands](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IL6A0I6).

6. Which track did you follow.
 - I followed the "Lean" track.

## One last thing...
If I can do this, anybody can. I know that might sound clich√©, but seriously - you can do it. If you have more questions please let me know!
